The belly button, or umbilicus as it's called in medical lingo, is simply a residual scar that's usually almost imperceptible to see and is where the placenta from the mother is attached to the puppy in the womb.<h2>Can a dog choke on an ice cube?</h2>The ice cubes need to be an appropriate size for your dog, for example a small dog can't be given a large ice cube as they can pose a choking risk.
