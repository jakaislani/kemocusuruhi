With so much attention surrounding him, people are intrigued to learn about his diet and workout plan. Many also search for Trevor Lawrence weight loss.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>An American football quarterback, Trevor Lawrence stands at an impressive height of 6 ft 6 inches, and weighs 213 lb.&nbsp;</p><p>The athlete who plays for the Jacksonville Jaguars of the National Football League (NFL) has set many records at the young age of 23.</p><p>As a freshman, Trevor won the 2019 National Championship Game at Clemson University and established the school record for most quarterback victories.</p><p>Additionally, he is regarded as one of the most highly anticipated college football prospects.</p><p>Lawrence, who was chosen first overall by the Jaguars in the 2021 NFL Draft, had a breakthrough campaign in 2022, leading the team to its first divisional title and playoff victory since 2017.</p><p><strong>Also Read:</strong> <a href=#>Kari Lake Weight Loss Before And After: Has She Done Plastic Surgery?</a>&nbsp;</p><h2>Trevor Lawrence Weight Loss Before And After</h2><p>Athletes are often concerned about their health since their physical health is of particular significance.&nbsp;</p><p>Like any other athlete, Trevor is also considerate about his health and believes in maintaining his weight.&nbsp;</p><p><span style=font-family:var(--global-body-font-family)>Since Trevor has always been fit, then he hasn’t had any significant weight loss, and you can see from his before and after photos that he has always maintained his weight in the same way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/geniuscelebs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Trevor-Lawrence-Weight.jpg><p>Although Lawrence has maintained a healthy weight, he has battled to gain weight his entire life.&nbsp;</p><p>Trevor must put on weight during the offseason because he will inevitably lose it throughout training camp and, possibly, a 15-game season, making it difficult for him to withstand the blows that quarterbacks receive.</p><p>“I think just my whole life that’s been something I’ve worked on is just trying to gain weight—every offseason just trying to gain as much weight as I can,” Trevor stated.</p><p>“The same thing happened this year. Since I’ve always been quite skinny and lean, I just attempted to gain a few additional pounds. You want to stay as long as possible because the season is lengthy, can wear on you, and sometimes hits. Therefore, gaining weight greatly helps.”</p><p>Nonetheless, Lawrence is familiar with the difficulties of gaining weight, if any quarterback out there battles with it.</p><h2>Trevor Lawrence’s Diet And Workout Explained&nbsp;</h2><p>Lawrence, who is 6 feet 6 inches tall and weighs 213 pounds, is renowned for his powerful quarterback skills and a tall, lean build.</p><p>He is constantly seeking ways to bulk up and toughen himself. The NFL player admitted that he enjoyed eating peanut butter and strawberry sandwiches in 2019.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, every day, he has two peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. He prefers crunchy peanut butter that is mixed with strawberry jelly.</p><p>Regarding his workout routine, Trevor works daily on his body to look fit and remain healthy.</p><h2>Who Is The NFL Player’s Partner?&nbsp;</h2><p>Trevor shares a prosperous professional career, and his personal life thrives equally.&nbsp;</p><p>The Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback has happily married his wife, Marissa Lawrence, since 2021.</p><p>The athlete met his future wife in 2016 when the duo was still in high school. The two got engaged in 2020 in the Clemson University stadium and exchanged wedding vows a year later.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/geniuscelebs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Trevor-Lawrence-Partner.jpg><p>In April 2022, Trevor and Marissa marked their first anniversary since being husband and wife. The NFL player took his wife on the trip of a lifetime during the offseason, surprising her with it.</p><p>Furthermore, Trevor Lawrence’s wife is highly supportive of his budding career. Marissa reflected on his rookie NFL season in January 2022 and praised him for facing the challenges in his first year in the league.</p><p>We hope the pair’s love will shine even in the darkest days.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You May Also Like:</strong> <a href=#>James Nesbitt Weight Loss Journey: Does He Wear A Wig?
