The bout was stopped in the sixth round as a result of Wood’s startled state and unable to defend himself.</p><p>After winning the first five rounds, Wood put on an amazing performance and took command of the fight. However, Wood had to cut weight before the fight in order to stay inside the bout’s weight limit, and after a few rounds, Wood started to feel fatigued.</p><p>Following his defeat to McDonnell, Wood had a rematch against Martin Mubiru. He performed well and won via third-round TKO.</p><p>Then, after 3 more fights and 3 more victories at featherweight, he improved his skill level and boxed Josh Wale, the opponent who had forced his former adversary to a draw in a contest for the British crown.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/28133140/image-345-1024x717.png><p>Wood outboxed Josh Wale for the bulk of the fight, winning it by unanimous decision on all three scorecards in the final two of the ten rounds with eye-catching combinations and potent right hands.</p><p>Wood’s following match was a rematch with Lee Glover, who had defeated him in the amateurs seven years earlier, for the featherweight title of the Midlands Area.</p><p>Wood started the first round pot-shooting, forcing Glover to miss before delivering some powerful blows just before the bell.</p><p>The second round continued in the same manner, with Wood ultimately halting Glover with a powerful left and a well-timed barrage of punches, putting Glover to the canvas and preventing the score from being called.</p><p>On March 2, 2019, Wood competed against Abraham Osei Bonsu for the vacant Commonwealth featherweight championship. He dispatched Bonsu easily, winning by knockout in the second round.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/28133150/image-346.png><p>On May 10, 2019, Wood faced former Commonwealth featherweight champion Ryan Doyle in his maiden title defense.</p><p>By way of a knockout in the tenth round, Wood prevailed. With a left hook and a barrage of punches, he first knocked Doyle out before finishing him with a counterleft hook.</p><p>On October 4, 2019, Wood faced up against current WBO European featherweight champion David Oliver Joyce in the quarterfinal round of the Golden Contract Featherweight Tournament.</p><p>He prevailed through technical knockout in the ninth round. On February 21, 2020, Wood faced Jazza Dickens in the semifinals of The Golden Contract featherweight tournament and successfully defended his maiden WBO European championship.</p><p>He was defeated by a razor-thin majority decision. Dickens won the fight by scores of 95-94 and 96-94 from the first two judges, respectively, while the third judge gave the contest a 95-95 draw.</p><p>By way of a knockout in the tenth round, Wood prevailed.

On December 12, Santa Cruz gave up his championship, leaving Wood as the only reigning champion in the class.</p><p>On May 27, 2023, Wood was scheduled to face Mauricio Lara in Manchester Arena for the WBA featherweight championship. Lara was disqualified from keeping the belt after she failed to make weight by 3.8 lbs at the official weigh-ins, leaving only Wood qualified to take its place.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How tall is Leigh Wood?</h2><p>Leigh Wood stands at a height of 5 feet inches and weighs 125.9lbs.</p><p><strong>Source:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">www.Ghgossip.com</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqWcop%2BYYsSwu8Nmn56hl53BbrTOsGStmZyheqq%2FjKWcop%2BYYsSwu8No</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./midnight-madness-1980.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Midnight Madness movie review (1980)">&larr;
