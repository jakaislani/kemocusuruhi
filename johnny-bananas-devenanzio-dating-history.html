Therefore, it would not be an exaggeration to say that he has been linked with multiple beautiful women outside his profession.</p><p>First and foremost, Devenanzio began a romantic relationship with Olympic champion <strong>Hannah Teter</strong> in 2012. The relationship lasted for five years before calling it quits in 2017.
