Sebastian Stan plays him in the 1990s when he was married to Pamela Anderson and became famous for it.</p><p>The American musician is still the drummer for the heavy metal band Motley Crue, which he helped start. Tommy also started the rap-metal band Methods of Mayhem and has worked on many solo music projects over the years.</p><p>In 2004, he was the star of Tommy Lee Goes to College, an <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">NBC</a> reality show.</p><h2>What’s Tommy Lee’s age?</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.therconline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/How-tall-is-Tommy-Lee-Height-1024x793.webp alt="What's Tommy Lee's age?" width=1024 height=793 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>On October 3, 1962, Tommy Lee was born. In 2021, on his 59th birthday, he had a party. Thomas Lee Bass was born in Athens, Greece. His father was an American US Army sergeant named David Lee Thomas Bass, and his mother, Vassiliki “Voula” Papadimitriou, was a contestant in the 1957 Miss Greece beauty pageant.</p><p>Athena, who is younger than him, is also a drummer. When Tommy was two years old, his father moved the family back to the United States. They lived in California.</p><p><strong>Read More:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Is Dr. Dre, An American Rapper Who Is Well-Known, Still Alive?</a></p><h2>Does Anyone Know If Tommy Lee Is Dead or Alive?</h2><p>Indeed, he is still among the living. Tommy Lee is a native of Athens, Greece. When it comes to his private life, Thomas Lee Bass is happy and successful.</p><p>Once upon a time, a tragic death rumor circulated, but it turned out to be untrue. In 2004, he began appearing in films and television shows like <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Tommy Lee Go to College</a>, Lucaris, Battleground Earth, and many more.</p><h2>How much money did Tommy Lee make in Mötley Crüe?</h2><p>Tommy Lee, one of the band’s original members, is now worth more than any of the others because of his success with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Mötley Crüe</a>. The Richest claims that Lee first started cashing cheques with the band after the release of their debut album, Too Fast For Love, in 1981, which reportedly made the rock star around $1 million.</p><p>Lee made a remarkable $4,335,000 on the release of the group’s second album, Shout at the Devil, two years later, which went on to be certified four times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.</p><p>After the success of their debut album, Lee earned tens of millions more for his work with the band. He made an estimated $4.3 million for his contributions to the 1985 album Theatre of Pain, $4.2 million for his work on the 1987 album Girls, Girls, Girls, and a staggering $6.4 million for his work on the 1989 album <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Dr. Feelgood</a>.</p><p>Another source of income for Lee and his bandmates was the sale of compilation and live albums. Their Greatest Hits record from 1998, for example, is said to have earned Lee an additional $500,000 on its own.</p><p>The Richest reports that Lee has made over $26 million during his time with Mötley Crüe. During her prime, his ex-wife Pamela Anderson earned an estimated $6.6 million, while she earned around $300,000 per episode of Baywatch.</p><h2>Pamela and Tommy’s relationship was intense but brief.</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.therconline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/tommy-lee-motley-crue-the-dirt-netflix-premiere-1024x683.jpg alt="Pamela and Tommy's relationship was intense but brief." width=1024 height=683 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Tommy and Pam fell in love quickly after Tommy’s divorce from his second wife, Heather Locklear. They met at a party on New Year’s Eve in 1994 and got married 96 hours later in Cancun, Mexico.</p><p>Pamela told People in 2015, “There was Tommy and then there was nobody else.” “It was love at first sight, for sure.” Before splitting up in 1998, they raised two children—Brandon Thomas, now 25, and Dylan Jagger, now 24.</p><p>Marie Claire reports that Pamela filed for divorce some months after Tommy was arrested for hitting her and given a six-month prison sentence.</p><p>Tommy reconciled with his ex-wife in 2008, a full decade after their divorce. He made the announcement in Rolling Stone. Pamela and the kids are living with me now,” he told the magazine. “That’s sick, dude. There can be no doubt that it is effective.</p><p>Seeing the smiles on the kids’ faces when we’re all together is the best reward for us. However, its duration was brief. In 2010, the couple appeared to end their relationship for good.</p><h2>He and Pamela now share parenting responsibilities.</h2><p></p><p>You won’t believe it, but the drummer is a supportive parent who shares custody of his children with his ex-wife. Pamela opens up to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Howard Stern</a> about raising her sons with Tommy in a 2015 interview.</p><p>She emphasized that the couple “makes a great effort” to speak as one while communicating with their children. Tommy is quite demanding, insisting that the lads avoid being spoilt and instead work hard. I text Tommy and all day he texts me, “breath, be strong.”</p><p>Aw! I think it’s hilarious that these two wild kids are going to raise two more wild kids. That concludes our discourse on development and maturity.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq5qoppyeu6Z6wqikaJuVobKjvsitsGiho2LBsLnMsmSlnZViwLW1y6VkmqSZq7JwfZRpb25n</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./monique-de-dios-net-worth-228374.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Monique de Dios Net Worth">&larr;
