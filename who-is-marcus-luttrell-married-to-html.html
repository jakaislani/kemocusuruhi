Because of his valour, Luttrell has earned the title of hero.</p><p></p><h3>What is the difference between the SEAL teams and other military units?</h3><p>There aren’t any significant distinctions between the different SEAL units. Currently, there are around 2,500 active SEAL personnel, who are organised into nine distinct teams by the Navy.
