In the film there is a “queering” of the relationship between the two lead characters and there are several obvious nods that <b>they are in fact a couple</b>. They bicker like a couple, take care of each other like a couple and banter like a couple. To all intents and purposes they are a couple.</p><p>How does wazowski poop? He <b>poops through his mouth</b>, and he has some sort of coating he can put over his tongue so that he doesn’t taste anything. He has a hole that opens only when he needs to poop, similar to how humans have the epiglottis stopping us from drinking food and eating water, although it’s almost reversed.</p><p>in the same way, What does Schmoopsie poo mean? <b>I love you</b>, Schmoopsie-poo! Move it! Je t’aime, ma Bichounette ! I love you, Schmoopsie-poo!</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_plays_the_voice_of_Mike_Wazowski%E2%80%99s_girlfriend></span>Who plays the voice of Mike Wazowski’s girlfriend?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><b>Jennifer Tilly</b> plays Celia Mae</p><p>Mike’s one-eyed and snake-haired girlfriend, Celia Mae has been promoted from Monsters, Incorporated receptionist to Laugh Floor supervisor. What else has Jennifer Tilly been in?</p><p>Why do Mike and Sulley live together? In Monster’s Inc, why do Mike and Sulley live together? – Quora. <b>Because we’re partners and we’ve been friends since we both went to Monsters University</b>. We both have enough money to just rent one good apartment though.</p><p>How old is wazowski? Age. <b>28</b> (Monsters, Inc.)</p><p>Does Sully have a last name? James P. … <b>James Patrick Sullivan</b> (better known as Sulley) is the protagonist of the 2001 Disney•Pixar animated film Monsters, Inc.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_does_2319_mean></span>What does 2319 mean?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>“2319” is the CDA code for <b>“white sock</b>,” which means contact with a human child. Fans of the film might remember; when one monster — George — returns from the other side with a tiny sock stuck to his back.</p><p>What does 2319 mean in Disney? A “2319” is factor code at the Monster’s Inc. <b>for a White Sock being found in the monster’s realm</b> because in the alphabet the 23rd letter is W and the 19th is S which is W.S for White Sock.</p><p>Does wazowski wink or blink?</p><p>Does Mike Wazowski wink or blink? wink is to keep one eye open, and shut the other. He only has one eye. Therefore, <b>he blinks</b>.</p><p>How old is Sully from Monsters Inc? In Monsters University, it is said that he is 18, so in Monsters Inc., he is <b>probably 28</b>. Despite this, John Goodman was around 48 during the production of the first film, and around 60 during the production of the prequel. According to his scare card, he was born August 17 and is from Sludge Falls.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_does_wazowski_say></span>What does wazowski say?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mike Wazowski: Scary monsters do not have plaque! Mike Wazowski: <b>Roz, my tender, oozing blossom, you’re looking fabulous today</b>. Is that a new haircut? Tell me it’s a new haircut.</p><p>Who does voice of Val little?</p><p><b>Mindy Kaling</b> as Val Little: Tylor’s acquaintance from Monsters University who shared a single class with him before she dropped out. She is also an enthusiastic mechanic. Henry Winkler as Fritz: Tylor’s friendly and scatterbrained one-eyed Tapir-nosed boss.</p><p>Who did John Goodman voice? John Goodman is a voice actor known for voicing <b>Sullivan, Hound, and Pacha</b>.</p><p>Why is Roz mad at Mike Wazowski? Personality. Roz is grumpy, especially to Mike due <b>that she is always bugging about the paperwork he does not file</b>.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Boo_in_Toy_story_4></span>Is Boo in Toy story 4?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Boo herself actually does <b>make two brief cameo appearances</b> in the sequel Toy Story 4 where she appears in Bonnie’s kindergarten class and at the carnival.</p><p>Will Boo be in Monsters Inc series? Will Boo appear in the Disney+ series at some point? The developer and executive producer of Monsters At Work, Bobs Gannaway, spoke to the New York Times to break the sad news to hopeful fans. <b>Boo from Monsters, Inc. will not return for the sequel series, Monsters At</b> Work.</p><p>Why is Randall not in Monsters at Work?</p><p>If you have seen the original film, then you will remember that <b>Waternoose, the boss of Monsters Inc was arrested by the CDA</b>. So he will not be appearing in the series. Similarly, Randall will not return for the series, either.</p><p>Why is Randall after Boo in Monsters, Inc? <b>Randall intended to simply return her to her room after the test</b>, and didn’t want to pick a kid old enough to verbalize what had happened to them once they got back home. They could not describe what they’d seen to anyone, so it was necessary to pick a child that was too young to really talk just yet.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_old_is_Boo_at_the_end_of_Monsters_Inc></span>How old is Boo at the end of Monsters, Inc?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Mary Gibbs as Boo, a <b>two-year-old human toddler</b> girl who is unafraid of any monster except Randall, the scarer assigned to her door. She believes Sulley is a large cat and refers to him as “Kitty”.</p><p>What ethnicity is Boo? Role in Monsters, Inc. In the film, Boo is a 2-year-old human child. She is presumably <b>of Asian descent</b> and speaks mostly in gibberish due to her age, who has escaped from her room from which Randall intended to kidnap her. Much of the film’s plot follows what happens as Sulley and Mike try to get Boo back to safety.</p><h2></h2><p>Don’t forget to share this post !</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbBnnp1kxKmt02abqJ2jYrCmr8iloJplk5a5rXnMoqKeZaeWx7DD0qSgaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./arlington-road-1999.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Arlington Road movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1999)">&larr;
