It was presumed that Molly McCann was related to Pimblett but it was later revealed that the two were not related in anyway.</p><p>Pimblett attended St Margaret Mary’s Primary school and Cardinal Heenan Catholic High school.</p><p>He began training in mixed martial arts at the age of 14, joining Next Generation MMA, after being inspired by the match between Diego Sanchez and Clay Guida at The Ultimate Fighter 9 Finale. Shortly after, he made the decision to compete in the sport professionally.</p><p>Pimblett made his debut in 2012 at the age of 17, going 3-0, and a year later signing with Cage Warriors. He won the Cage Warriors featherweight title in 2016 after defeating Johnny Frachey at the Echo Arena in Liverpool. He then successfully defended the title against Julian Erosa, coming out on top in a somewhat contentious unanimous decision.</p><p>Pimblett stepped up to lightweight after losing to Nad Narimani in April 2017. Following a victory, he was opposed for the lightweight Cage Warriors title, but Sren Bak ultimately prevailed by unanimous decision.</p><p>Pimblett joined the Ultimate Fighting Championship after two more victories in the group. Pimblett previously turned down two UFC contracts in favor of higher financial incentives from Cage Warriors.</p><p>On September 4, 2021, at UFC Fight Night 191, Pimblett faced off against Luigi Vendramini in his first promotional match. First-round knockout by Pimblett gave him the victory. He received a Performance of the Night bonus for this fight.</p><p>Pimblett and Barstool Sports agreed to an endorsement contract for more than $1,000,000 in October 2021. On March 19, 2022, Pimblett and Rodrigo Vargas squared off at UFC Fight Night 204.</p><p>In the opening round, he was submitted to win the fight. He won again, earning the title of Performance of the Night for the second time in a row. Later, Pimblett would admit he had received $12,000 to enter and another $12,000 to win.</p><p>At UFC Fight Night: Blaydes vs. Aspinall on July 23, 2022, Pimblett took against Jordan Leavitt as his next opponent. In the second round, he submitted by rear-naked choke to win the bout. With this victory, he was given the Performance of the Night prize.</p><p>At UFC 282, Pimblett took on Jared Gordon on December 10, 2022. He prevailed by unanimous decision in the fight.</p><p>Many media outlets, athletes, and fans expressed disagreement with the verdict since they thought Gordon had won the battle. 24 out of 24 media outlets gave Gordon the win in the fight.</p><p>According to Pimblett, youngsters can relate to him in a way that is impossible if he were a big rough bloke with loads of tattoos because of his distinctive floppy hair and absence of ink.</p><p>He has stated his desire to engage in combat at Anfield, the home pitch of Liverpool FC. Pimblett describes himself as a socialist and an opponent of the Conservative Party.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Paddy Pimblett’s weight?</h2><p>Pimblett weighs 71kg. He puts on too much weight that most people believe it is too much for a fighter like himself. The reason for Paddy’s weight gain between fights is because&nbsp;he likes to eat and would rather be fat and happy.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqmYnZypYr2qucGlnK2sXayyqrPHrWY%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-getaway-1972.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Getaway movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1972)">&larr;
